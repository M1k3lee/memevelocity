# Alternative Solution: Direct Blockchain Monitoring

Since PumpPortal is blocked, here are alternative approaches to get REAL pump.fun token data:

## Option 1: Use Helius RPC (Recommended)
Helius provides WebSocket access to Solana blockchain with enhanced APIs.

1. Sign up at https://helius.dev (free tier available)
2. Get your API key
3. Update the app to use Helius WebSocket for monitoring pump.fun program

## Option 2: Use QuickNode
QuickNode also provides Solana RPC with WebSocket support.

1. Sign up at https://quicknode.com
2. Create a Solana mainnet endpoint
3. Use their WebSocket URL

## Option 3: Monitor Pump.fun Program Directly
Instead of PumpPortal, monitor the pump.fun program address directly:
- Program ID: `6EF8rrecthR5Dkzon8Nwu78hRvfCKubJ14M5uBEwF6P`

This requires:
1. WebSocket connection to Solana RPC
2. Subscribe to program account changes
3. Parse token creation events

## Option 4: Use Alternative Data Providers
- **Birdeye API**: Real-time token data
- **DexScreener API**: New token launches
- **Jupiter API**: Token metadata

## Immediate Action Required

**You MUST resolve the network connectivity issue to use real data.**

Try these steps:
1. **Disable VPN temporarily** - test if it works without VPN
2. **Try mobile hotspot** - bypass your home network entirely  
3. **Contact your ISP** - ask if they block cryptocurrency services
4. **Use a different computer** - test if it's machine-specific

**Without network access to either PumpPortal OR Solana RPC, Paper Trading with real data is impossible.**

The app is fully functional - the network is the blocker.
